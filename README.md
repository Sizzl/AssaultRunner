# AssaultRunner - Offline edition
Enhanced scoreboard timer for UT99 Assault speed runs

## Installation

Download the latest .u and .int files from the Releases section of this repo, placing them in your UnrealTournament\System folder.

### Prerequisites

This mod has a prerequisite of LeagueAS140 (including server files). This can be downloaded from https://utassault.net/leagueas/files/LeagueAS140.zip, with unpacked files placed in their respective System and Textures folders.

## Usage

### Starting ASARO via the User Interface

- Through the Unreal Tournament UI, select the Game menu then Start Practice Session.
- Select Unreal Tournament as the category.
- Select League Assault 140 as the Game Type.
- Pick your map
- Open the mutators window
- Select (double-click) the "Assault Runner - Offline" mutator (or ASARO if the localisation file is not present) to move it to the "Mutators Used" column.
- Close the mutators window
- Press Start

### Starting ASARO via command line

Either through the UT console, or as a command-line parameter in a shortcut when launching UT:
- `open AS-Bridge?game=LeagueAS140.LeagueAssault?mutator=ASARO1g.ASARO`

### Commands

The AssaultRunner mutator supports the following commands:

 - `mutate ar info` - Displays version info
 - `mutate ar restart` - Restarts and resets the current map
 - `mutate ar change` - Changes the current spawn point, can only be run while the map has not yet started and you are in "free-flight spectator" mode
 - `mutate ar switch` - Per `mutate ar change`, but instead of moving the camera around while changing, this just switches the active spawn, so as a spectator, you can fly out and watch the spawn points cycle around.
 - `mutate ar demo` - Toggles automatic demo recording. Demos will be dropped into the System folder prefixed with a sortable date stamp.
 - `mutate ar cheat` - Cheats are disabled by default, using this command will unlock built in commands such as "god", "ghost", "fly", "summon"; however, toggling this or using any of those commands will "taint" the final screenshot to show that cheats have been used.
 
 
 #### Debug commans
 - `mutate ar debug` - Provides additional debug information.
 - `mutate ar forts` - Lists all known objectives (FortStandards) and their completion status
 - `mutate ar list` - Lists all spawn points (PlayerStarts)
 - `mutate ar showps` - Unhides all spawn points (PlayerStarts), even after the map has started
 - `mutate ar superdebugÂ¬ - Very verbose debug information.
